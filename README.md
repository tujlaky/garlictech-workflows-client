# Workflow management for Garlic Tech projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/garlictech/garlictech-workflows-client.svg?token=PrxB3e9orjydN7XUbkZL&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/garlictech/garlictech-workflows-client)

The information below applies all the Garlic Tech projects.

## Installation

After cloning, do the usual

```npm install```

The instal process will create a `.env` file. Edit it, to add development setup. Probably the first thing is: uncomment the ```NODE_ENV=development``` line. Mind, that the e2e test bundle is built only if this environment variable is set.

## Commands during development

 * Start a development web server, with livereload:

```npm start```

 * Build the project (in the ```dist``` directory):

```npm run build```

 * Run the unit tests:

```npm run unittest```

In development mode it will watch sources anr re-run tests on changes. In production mode, it runs it once.

* Important *: Currently, karma requires that the dist folder exists, with the compiled project. So, before running unittests, make sure that you issued `npm run build` at least once.

 * Set up selenium (do in once):

```npm run protractor-setup```

Postinstall tries to execute this step. Use this command explicitly it it failed for some reason.

* Start selenium server for protractor tests:

```npm run protractor-start```

* Execute e2e tests (selenium must be running):

```npm run e2e-tests```

Before running it, you have to start selenium (```npm run protractor-start```) and a web server serving the project (```npm start```). Also, ensure, that the webpack bundle containing the test app is built.

* Watch source changes

```npm run start-watch```

This command watches source files and rebuilds the project if it changes. It does not start development server. The command is useful when you develop ionic applications with livereload: project is built in the dist folder, and the emulator can reload the app.

* Profile webpack build

```npm run webpack-profile```

It produces a ```webpack-stats.json``` file. Upload it to the [Webpack analyse tool](http://webpack.github.io/analyse/) and <enjoy class=""></enjoy>

### Gulp commands

They are really done during development. Available gulp commands:

```gulp help```

You can find some more info in https://github.com/garlictech/garlictech-workflows-common.

## Content of package.json

* `main` filed should be present: it should be the index file that is the main entry point of the package. Karma, etc. uses it!
